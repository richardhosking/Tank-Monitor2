Arduino code to drive an ultrasonic level monitor A01NYUB
This device from DFRobot is not well documented software wise 
It appears to generate a burst of data every 100msec or so - uses a serial interface 
There is no documentation of how to send data to the device
It seems to require 1 sec or so to initialize
